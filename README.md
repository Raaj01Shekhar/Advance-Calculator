Calculators hold an indispensable role in modern education. The realms of science and engineering are progressively intertwining with various branches of knowledge over time, aiding in elucidating and characterizing the intricate natural phenomena that manifest daily. These spheres of knowledge, particularly mathematics, are exerting influence even on seemingly disparate domains of information that were hitherto considered devoid of mathematical involvement.

Mathematics finds its place within the realm of art, permeating all artistic endeavors. Specifically, in the realm of designing and analyzing engineering systems, computations are progressively extending in both complexity and length. In this context, the utilization of scientific calculators proves advantageous. Nevertheless, mastering the skill of effective computation is attainable through learning.

This project introduces an advanced calculator application encompassing distinct modules: Simple Calculator, Scientific Calculator, Trigonometric Calculator, and Programming Calculator. These modules significantly enhance computation efficiency and time-saving capabilities.
